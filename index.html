            <p class="left-about-para">The Staatliches Bauhaus was a German art and design school founded by German architect Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, in 1919. The school has had a significant influence on design philosophy and has affected multiple arts, design, and crafts disciplines.</p>
            <p class="left-about-para">Gropius himself was an architect, and "Bau" translates to "build" or "architecture" in German. The architecture school was central to the curriculum of the design school and influenced its approach to design, creating a style that was concerned with form, structure, and functionality.</p>

        <div id="right-about">
            <p class="right-about-para">The school itself ignited an entire movement that would change design history.  Modern furniture designers, graphic designers, architects, and painters still often work with principles developed at The Bauhaus.</p>
            <p class="right-about-para">The Bauhaus movement affected so many disciplines due to Gropius' grand vision of bringing all arts and crafts together under one roof. It was founded upon the intention to unite art forms and create a Gesamtkunstwerk, meaning a “comprehensive artwork.”</p>
