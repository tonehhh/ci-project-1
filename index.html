                The Staatliches Bauhaus was a German art and design school founded by German architect Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, in 1919. The school has had a significant influence on design philosophy and has affected multiple arts, design, and crafts disciplines.

            <p>
                Gropius himself was an architect, and "Bau" translates to "build" or "architecture" in German. The architecture school was central to the curriculum of the design school and influenced its approach to design, creating a style that was concerned with form, structure, and functionality.

            <p>
                The school itself ignited an entire movement that would change design history.  Modern furniture designers, graphic designers, architects, and painters still often work with principles developed at The Bauhaus.

            <li>
                <p>The Bauhaus movement affected so many disciplines due to Gropius' grand vision of bringing all arts and crafts together under one roof. It was founded upon the intention to unite art forms and create a Gesamtkunstwerk, meaning a “comprehensive artwork.”</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Bauhaus School of design taught design fundamentals, color theory, fine art, and of course, the famed architecture program. There was a wide array of workshops available from painting to weaving, interior design, industrial design, and beyond. The school nurtured many famous furniture designers and artists. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>To this day, Bauhaus remains one of the most influential design movements of all time, having married functional design with aesthetic pleasure to create a modern art form that could bring beauty to everyday objects and beyond.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The Bauhaus school was and is so multi-faceted and heterogeneous that deriving a uniform style is impossible. And this is what makes it so interesting and topical to this very day. The democratic idea, the demonstrative forthrightness and modernity, as well as the timeless topicality of the “Bauhaus classics”: all serve to illustrate the social self-understanding.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Thus, Gropius’ guiding idea of synthesis of the arts through the collaboration of art and craftsmanship has once again come to the fore. Today, workpieces such as the Bauhaus lamp represent a symbol of the cosmopolitanism and diversity that made the Bauhaus school in Weimar the starting point of an epoch in 1919.</p>
