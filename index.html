            The Bauhaus was an art and design school in Germany whose importance is astonishing given its very brief and tenuous existence. The desk lamp and chair illustrated here are so familiar and so simple that they don’t seem to have required a designer, but they were as radical in their time as they are commonplace now, and their apparent simplicity was the result of a thoughtful and meticulous design education and design process that remains a model today.

            During its fourteen years of existence the Bauhaus was forced to change location three times and was ultimately closed as a result of political pressure from the Nazi party. Founded by Walter Gropius in 1919, the school originally had three aims: to abolish the “arrogant” distinction between artist and craftsperson by recognizing the knowledge and skills common to both; to mobilize all arts and crafts towards the creation of total design environments; and, to foster links between the school and local manufacturers.

            Founded by the architect Walter Gropius (1883–1969) in 1919, the Bauhaus was a utopian haven for avant-garde artists during the period of radical change and tenuous peace in Germany after World War I. A war veteran, Gropius found his battered country badly in need of rejuvenation and believed that the collective of Bauhaus artists could play an important role in that process. Based on the concept of the medieval cooperative of artists and craftsmen combining their talents to build the great Gothic cathedrals, the progressive school of art and design sought to bring together the fine and applied arts, human ingenuity, and modern technology in order to help construct a new rational, egalitarian, and ordered society.
